Project just for learning about node.js, i will try to do an orm for node.js applications.

Following the steps to do it real:

node.js with express <3


1-) learn more about "oop" in javascript applications;
2-) create the interation between the app and the database with more abstraction as possible, haha.
3-) by now is just this...
